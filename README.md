# CS150 - InClass Examples
For the remainder of the semester, I will push the notebooks I use in class to GitHub. If you want to sync up with my examples, you can do:
    git clone https://github.com/r2klabs/CS150-InClass f

or the first time clone and 
    git pull origin master 

to retrieve the daily updates.
