# CS150 - InClass Examples
For the remainder of the semester, I will push the notebooks I use in class to GitHub. If you want to sync up with my examples, you can do:

**git clone https://github.com/r2klabs/CS150-InClass** 

to clone the repo for the first time. You can use:
 
**git pull origin master** 

to retrieve the daily updates - it will just refresh your local repository.
